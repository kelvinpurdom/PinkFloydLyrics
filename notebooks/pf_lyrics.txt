Always sitting by your side  Always by your side.  That cat's something I can't explain.  Ginger, ginger, Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.  You're the left side  He's the right side.  Oh, no!

With silver eyes the scarlet eagle  Showers silver on the people.  Oh Mother, tell me more.  Why'd'ya have to leave me there  Hanging in my infant air  Waiting?  You only have to read the lines  They're scribbly black and everything shines.  Across the stream with wooden shoes  With bells to tell the king the news  A thousand misty riders climb up  Higher once upon a time.  Wandering and dreaming  The words have different meaning.  Yes they did.  For all the time spent in that room  The doll's house, darkness, old perfume  And fairy sories held me high on  Clouds of sunlight floating by.  Oh Mother, tell me more  Tell me more.  Aaaaaaaah  Aaaaaaaah  AaaaaaaahAlone in the clouds all blue Lying on an eiderdown. Yippee! You can't see me But I can you. Lazing in the foggy dew Sitting on a unicorn. No fair, you can't hear me But I can you. Watching buttercups cup the light Sleeping on a dandelion. Too much, I won't touch you But then I might. Screaming through the starlit sky Travelling by telephone. Hey ho, here we go Ever so high. Alone in the clouds all blue Lying on an eiderdown. Yippee! You can't see me But I can you.Doctor doctor!  I'm in bed  Achin' head  Gold is lead  Choke on bread  Underfed  Gold is lead  Jesus bled  Pain is red  Are goon  Grow go  Greasy spoon  You swoon  June bloom  Music seems to help the pain  Seems to cultivate the brain.  Doctor kindly tell your wife that  I'm alive - flowers thrive - realize - realize  Realize.I want to tell you a story  About a little man  If I can.  A gnome named Grimble Grumble.  And little gnomes stay in their homes.  Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.  He wore a scarlet tunic,  A blue green hood,  It looked quite good.  He had a big adventure  Amidst the grass  Fresh air at last.  Wining, dining, biding his time.  And then one day - hooray!  Another way for gnomes to say  Hoooooooooray.  Look at the sky, look at the river  Isn't it good?  Look at the sky, look at the river  Isn't it good?  Winding, finding places to go.  And then one day - hooray!  Another way for gnomes to say  Hoooooooooray.  Hooooooooooooooray.A movement is accomplished in six stages  And the seventh brings return.

His head did no thinking  His arms didn't move except then the wind cut up  Rough and mice ran around on the ground  He stood in a field where barley grows.  The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me  But now he's resigned to his fate  'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind.  He stood in a field where barley grows.Far, far, far away - way  People heard him say - say  I will find a way - way  There will come a day - day  Something will be done.  Then at last the mighty ship  Descending on a point of flame  Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall   Now, now, now is the time - time  Time to be - be - be aware  Carter's father saw him there  and knew the Rhull revealed to him  the glowing soul of Hereward The Wake.   Oh, my, something in my eye - eye  Something in the sky - sky  Waiting there for me  The outer lock rolls slowly back  The service men were heard to sigh  For there revealed in glowing robes  Was Lucy in the sky   Oh - oh - did you ever know - know  Never ever will they  I cannot say  Summoning his cosmic powers  And glowing slightly from his toes  The psychic emanations flyRemember a day before today  A day when you were young.  Free to play alone with time  Evening never came.

Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn Lotuses lean on each other in yearning Under the eaves the swallow is resting  Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  Over the mountain watching the watcher. Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine. One inch of love is one inch of shadow Love is the shadow that ripens the wine.  Set the controls for the heart of the sun. The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.  Witness the man who raves at the wall Making the shape of his questions to Heaven Whether the sun will fall in the evening Will he remember the lesson of giving?

And I never knew the moon could be so big  And I never knew the moon could be so blue  And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes  And brought me here instead dressed in red  And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.  I don't care if the sun don't shine  And I don't care if nothing is mine  And I don't care if I'm nervous with you  I'll do my loving in the winter.  And the sea isn't green  And I love the queen  And what exactly is a dream  And what exactly is a joke.In a churchyard by a river,  Lazing in the haze of midday,  Laughing in the grasses and the graze.  Yellow bird, you are alone in singing and in flying on,  In and in leaving. Willow weeping in the water,  Waving to the river daughters,  Swaying in the ripples and the reeds.  On a trip to Cirrus Minor, saw a crater in the sun  A thousand miles of moonlight later.I was standing by the Nile  Whe I saw the lady smile.  I would take her out for a while,  For a while.   Light tears wept like a child.  How her golden hair was blowing wild.  Then she spread her wings to fly,  For to fly.   Soaring high above the breezes,  Going always where she pleases.  She will make it to the island in the sun.  I will follw in her shadow  As I watch her from my window.  One day I will catch her eye.   She is calling from the deep,  Summoning my soul to endless sleep.  She is bound to drag me down,  Drag me down.We smile and smile  We smile and smile  Laughter echoes in your eyes  We climb and climb  We climb and climb  Footfall softly in the pines  We cry and cry  We cry and cry  Sadness passes in a while  We role and role  We role and role  Help me role away the stoneHeavy hung the canopy of blue  Shade my eyes and I can see you  White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore  She lay in the shadow of the wave  Hazy were the visions of her playing  Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine beat her blind everytime  Green is the colour of her kind  Quickness of the eye deceives the mind  Many is the bond between the hopefull and the damnedI'm so afraid of mistakes that I made  Taking every time that I wake  I feel like a hard-boiled butter man  So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind   Are days are made since the first page  I've lived every line that you wrote  Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head  So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind   And if I live on the shelf like the rest  And if love bleeds like a sad song  Please pick-up your camera and use me again  So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind  YeaBath of tequila, Manuel  Listen Gringo  Laugh at my lisp and kill you  I think  This Spanish music  It sets my soul on fire  Lovely seniorita  Your eyes are like stars  Your teeth are like pearls  Your ruby lips senioritaLime and limpid green, a second scene A fight between the blue you once knew.

Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds  Belied a deathly silence that lay all around.  Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.  See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.  And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,  Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.  In the lazy water meadow  I lay me down.  All around me,  Golden sunflakes settle on the ground,  Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,  Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.

Thank you.Following the path as it leads towards the Darkness in the North Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy They've seen that hope before And if you want to stay for a little bit Rest your aching limbs for a little bit Before you the night is beckoning And you know you can't delay You hear the night birds calling you But you can't touch the restless sky Close your aching eyes beyond your name Mist is swelling, creatures crawling, Hear the roar get louder in your ears You know the folly was your own But the force behind can't conquer all your fears And if you want to stay for a little bit Rest your aching limbs for a little bit Before you the night is beckoning And you know you can't delay You hear the night birds calling you But you can't touch the restless sky Close your aching eyes beyond your name Throw your thoughts back many years To the time when there was life in every morning Perhaps a day will come When the nights will be as on that morning And if you want to stay for a little bit Rest your aching limbs for a little bit Before you the night is beckoning And you know you can't delay You hear the night birds calling you But you can't touch the restless sky Close your aching eyes beyond your name Rest your weary head, be on your way.If I were a swan, I'd be gone. If I were a train, I'd be late. And if I were a good man, I'd talk with you more often than I do. If I were to sleep, I could dream. If I were afraid, I could hide. If I go insane, please don't put your wires in my brain. If I were the moon, I'd be cool. If I were a rule, I would bend. If I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends. If I were alone, I would cry. And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry. And if I go insane, will you still let me join in with the game? If I were a swan, I'd be gone. If I were a train, I'd be late again. If I were a good man, I'd talk to you more often than I do.Would you like to say something before you leave? Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel. We say goodbye before we've said hello. I hardly even like you. I shouldn't care at all. We met just six hours ago. The music was too loud. From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year. And I would like to know, how do you feel? How do you feel? Not a single word was said. Delights still without fears. Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need? I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of ninetyfive. My friends are lying in the sun, I wish I was there. Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you. Have you time before you leave to greet another man Just to let me know, how do you feel? How do you feel? Goodbye to you. Charlotte Kringles too. I've had enough for one day.When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,  Summer evening birds are calling.  Summer's thunder time of year,  The sound of music in my ears.  Distant bells,  New mown grass smells so sweet.  By the river holding hands,  Roll me up and lay me down.  And if you sit,  Don't make a sound.  Pick your feet up off the ground.  And if you hear as the warm night falls  The silver sound from a time so strange,  Sing to me, sing to me.  When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,  Summer evening birds are calling.  Children's laughter in my ears,  The last sunlight disappears.  And if you sit,  Don't make a sound.  Pick your feet up off the ground.  And if you hear as the warm night falls  The silver sound from a time so strange,  Sing to me, sing to me.  When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,  Summer evening birds are calling.  Children's laughter in my ears,  The last sunlight disappears.Arnold Layne had a strange hobby Collecting clothes Moonshine washing line They suit him fine On the wall hung a tall mirror Distorted view, see through baby blue Oh, Arnold Layne It's not the same, takes two to know Two to know, two to know Why can't you see?

It's got a basket, a bell that rings and  Things to make it look good.  I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.  You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.  There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.  I've had it for months.  If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.  You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.  I don't know why. I call him Gerald.  He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.  You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  I've got a clan of gingerbread men.  Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.  Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

Let's go into the other room and make them work.One of these days   I'm going to cut you into little piecesA cloud of eider down  Draws around me softening the sound  Sleepy time when I lie  With my love by my side  And she's breathing low  And the candle dies.  When night comes down you lock the door  The boot falls to the floor  As darkness falls the waves roll by  The seasons change  The wind is warm.  Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan  Behold a dream, the dream is gone  Green fields  A cold rain is falling  Near the golden dawn.  And deep beneath the ground  The early morning sounds and I go down  Sleepy time in my life  With my love by my side  And she's breathing low  And I rise like a bird  In the haze and the first rays touch the sky  And the night winds die.You say the hill's too steep to climb,  Chiding!  You say you'd like to see me try,  Climbing!  You pick the place and I'll choose the time  And I'll climb  The hill in my own way  just wait a while, for the right day  And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds  I look down hear the sound of the things you said today  Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling  Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round, frowning  and who's the fool who wears the crown  Go down in your own way  And everyday is the right day  And as you rise above the fearlines in his frown  You look down  Hear the sound of the faces in the crowdAs I reach for a peach   Slide a rind down behind   the sofa in San Tropez   Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand   Riding a wave in the wake of an old Sedan   Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness   Scratched by the sand that fell from our love   Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling   If you're alone I'll come home   Backwards and home bound   The pidgeon the dove   Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane   Owning a home with no silver spoon   I'm drinking champaigne like a big tycoon   Sooner than wait for a break in the weather   I'll gather my far flung thoughts together   Speeding away on a wind to a new day   If your alone I'll come home   And I pause for a while   By a country style   And listen to things they say   Digging for gold in the hoe in my hand   Hoping they'll take a look at the way things stand   And you're leading me down to the place by the sea   I hear your soft voice calling to me   Making a date for later by phone   if you're alone I'll come homeI was in the kitchen   Seamus, that's the dog was outside   Well, I was in the kitchen   Seamus, my old hound was outside   Well, you know the sun was sinking slowly   But my hound just sat right down and criedOverhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves The echo of a distant tide Comes willowing across the sand And everything is green and submarine  And no one showed us to the land And no one knows the where's or why's But something stirs and something tries And starts to climb towards the light  Strangers passing in the street By chance two separate glances meet And I am you and what I see is me And do I take you by the hand And lead you through the land And help me understand the best I can And no one calls us to move on And no one forces down our eyes No one speaks And no one tries No one flies around the sun  Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes Inviting and inciting me to rise And through the window in the wall Come streaming in on sunlight wings A million bright ambassadors of morning  And no one sings me lullabies And no one makes me close my eyes So I throw the windows wide And call to you across the sky.Bridges burning gladly,  Merging with the shadows,  Flickering between the lines.  Stolen moments floating softly on the air,  Born on wings of fire and climbing higher.  Ancient bonds are breaking,  Moving on and changing sides.  Dreaming of a new day,  Cast aside the other way.  Magic visions stirring,  Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes.  The door stands ajar,  The wall that once were high.  Beyond the gilded cage,  Beyond the reach of ties.  The moment is at hand.  She breaks the golden band.Come on, my friends,  Let's make for the hills.  They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills.  You can get your hands on whatever we find,  Because I'm only coming along for the ride.  Well, you go your way,  I'll go mine.  I don't care if we get there on time.  Everybody's searching for something, they say.  I'll get my kicks on the way.  Over mountains, across seas,  Who knows what will be waiting for me?  I could sail forever to strange sounding names.  Faces of people and places don't change.  All I have to do is just close my eyes  To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies.  All I want to tell you,  All I want to say is count me in on the journey.  Don't expect me to stay.Heaven sent the promised land Looks allright from where I stand Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in  Waiting on the first step Show me where the key is kept Point me down the right line because it's time  To let me in from the cold Turn my lead into gold Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul And I think I'm growing old  Flash the readies wots...uh the deal Got to make to the next meal Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel.  Mile after mile Stone after stone Turn to speak but you're alone Million mile from home you're on your own  So let me in from the cold Turn my lead into gold Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul And I think I'm growing old  Fire bright by candlelight With her by my side And if she prefers we will never stir again  Someone sent the promised land And I grabbed it with both hands Now I'm the man on the inside looking out  Hear me shout 'come on in, what's the news and where you been?' Cause there's no wind left in my soul And I've grown oldYou shout in your sleep.  Perhaps the price is just too stepp.  Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?  You awake with a start to just the beating of your heart.  Just one man beneath the sky,  Just two ears, just two eyes.  You set sail across the sea of longpast thoughts and memories.  Childhood's end,  Your fantasies merge with harsh realities.  And then as the sail is hoist,  You find your eyes are growing moist.  All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice.  Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?  Some are born;  Some men die beneath one infinite sky.  There'll be war, there'll be peace.  But everything one day will cease.  All the iron turned to rust;  All the proud men turned to dust.  And so all things, time will mend.  So this song will end.The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You suffle in gloom in the sickroom And talk to yourself till you die. Life is a short, warm moment And death is a long cold rest. You get your chance to try In the twinkling of an eye: Eighty years, with luck, or even less. So all aboard for the American tour, And maybe you'll make it to the top. And mind how you go. I can tell you, because I know. You may find it hard to get off. You are the angel of death And I am the dead man's son. And he died like a mole in a fox hole. And everyone is still in the run. And who is the master of fox hounds? And who says the hunt has begun? And who calls the tune in the courtroom? And who beats the funeral drum? The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You suffle in gloom in the sickroom And talk to yourself till you die.Stay and help me to end the day.  And of you don't mind,  We'll break a bottle of wine.  Stick around and maybe we'll put one down,  Because I wanna find what lies behind those eyes.  Midnight blue burning gold.  A yellow moon is growing cold.  I rise, looking through my morning eyes,  Surprised to find you by my side.  Rack my brain to try to remember your name  To find the words to tell you goodbye.  Morning dues.  Newborn day.  Midnight blue turn to gray.  Midnight blue burning gold.  A yellow moon is growing cold."I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been  over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..."  "I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the  most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even  if you're not mad..."Breathe, breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground  For long you live and high you fly And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be  Run, rabbit, run Dig that hole, forget the sun, And when at last the work is done Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one  For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race toward an early grave.Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way  Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun  And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death  Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say  Home, home again I like to be here when I can When I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away, across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spellHome, home again  I like to be there when I can  When I come in cold and tired  It's good to warm my bones beside the fire  Far away across the field  The tolling of the iron bell  Calls the faithful to their knees  To hear the softly spoken magic spells."And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.  Why should I be frightened of dying?  There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."  "If you can hear this whispering you are dying."  "I never said I was frightened of dying."Money, get away Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K. Money, it's a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car, caviar, four star daydream, Think I'll buy me a football team  Money, get back I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack. Money, it's a hit Don't give me that do goody good bullshit I'm in the hi-fidelity first class traveling set And I think I need a Lear jet  Money, it's a crime Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie Money, so they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away  "HuHuh! I was in the right!" "Yes, absolutely in the right!" "I certainly was in the right!" "You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!" "Yeah!" "Why does anyone do anything?" "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!" "I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely. It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out."Us and Them And after all we're only ordinary men Me, and you God only knows it's not what we would choose to do Forward he cried from the rear and the front rank died And the General sat, as the lines on the map moved from side to side Black and Blue And who knows which is which and who is who Up and Down And in the end it's only round and round and round Haven't you heard it's a battle of words the poster bearer cried Listen son, said the man with the gun There's room for you inside  "Well I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I coulda given 'I'm a thrashin' but I only hit him once. It's only the difference between right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"  Down and Out It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about With, without And who'll deny that's what the fightings all about Get out of the way, it's a busy day And I've got things on my mind For want of the price of tea and a slice The old man diedThe lunatic is on the grass  The lunatic is on the grass  Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs  Got to keep the loonies on the path  The lunatic is in the hall  The lunatics are in my hall  The paper holds their folded faces to the floor  And every day the paper boy brings more  And if the dam breaks open many years too soon  And if there is no room upon the hill  And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon  The lunatic is in my head  The lunatic is in my head  You raise the blade, you make the change  You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane  You lock the door  And throw away the key  There's someone in my head but it's not me.  And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear  You shout and no one seems to hear  And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon   "I can't think of anything to say except...  I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"All that you touch  All that you see  All that you taste  All you feel  All that you love  All that you hate  All you distrust  All you save  All that you give  All that you deal  All that you buy  beg, borrow or steal  All you create  All you destroy  All that you do  All that you say  All that you eat  everyone you meet  All that you slight  everyone you fight  All that is now  All that is gone  All that's to come  And everything under the sun is in tune  But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.  There is no dark side of the moon really.  Matter of fact it's all dark.Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!  You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.  Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.  You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,   provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.  You bought a guitar to punish your ma,  And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,  So welcome to the machine.  Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.  What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.  You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,  He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.  So welcome to the machine.Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar. You're gonna go far, you're gonna fly high, You're never gonna die, you're gonna make it if you try; they're gonna love you.  Well, I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely. The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think. Oh by the way, which one's Pink?  And did we tell you the name of the game, boy? We call it Riding the Gravy Train.  We're just knocked out. We heard about the sell out. You gotta get an album out, You owe it to the people. We're so happy we can hardly count.  Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart? It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster If we all pull together as a team.  And did we tell you the name of the game, boy? We call it Riding the Gravy Train.So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.  Shine on you crazy diamond.  Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there.  Shine on you crazy diamond.  And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,   sail on the steel breeze.  Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,   come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shineIf you didn't care what happened to me,  And I didn't care for you  We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain  Occasionally glancing up through the rain  Wondering which of the buggers to blame  And watching for pigs on the wing.You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need  You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street  You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed  And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight  You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.  And after a while, you can work on points for style  Like the club tie, and the firm handshake  A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile  You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to  So that when they turn their backs on you  You'll get the chance to put the knife in.  You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder  You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older  And in the end you'll pack up, fly down south  Hide your head in the sand  Just another sad old man  All alone and dying of cancer.  And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown  And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone  And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around  So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone  Dragged down by the stone.  I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused  Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used  Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise  If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?  Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend  And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  And everythings done under the sun  And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.  Who was born in a house full of pain  Who was trained not to spit in the fan  Who was told what to do by the man  Who was broken by trained personnel  Who was fitted with collar and chain  Who was given a pat on the back  Who was breaking away from the pack  Who was only a stranger at home  Who was ground down in the end  Who was found dead on the phone  Who was dragged down by the stone.Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are  You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are  And when your hand is on your heart  You're nearly a good laugh  Almost a joker  With your head down in the pig bin  Saying "keep on digging"  Pig stain on your fat chin  What do you hope to find?  When you're down in the pig mine  You're nearly a laugh  You're nearly a laugh  But you're really a cry.  Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are  You fucked up old hag, ha ha, charade you are  You radiate cold shafts of broken glass  You're nearly a good laugh  Almost worth a quick grin  You like the feel of steel  You're hot stuff with a hat pin  And good fun with a hand gun  You're nearly a laugh  You're nearly a laugh  But you're really a cry.  Hey you Whitehouse, ha ha, charade you are  You house proud town mouse, ha ha, charade you are  You're trying to keep our feelings off the street  You're nearly a real treat  All tight lips and cold feet  And do you feel abused?  .....!.....!.....!.....!  You gotta stem the evil tide  And keep it all on the inside  Mary you're nearly a treat  Mary you're nearly a treat  But you're really a cry.Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away  Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air  You better watch out  There may be dogs about  I've looked over Jordan and I have seen  Things are not what they seem.   What do you get for pretending the danger's not real  Meek and obedient you follow the leader  Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel  What a surprise!  A look of terminal shock in your eyes  Now things are really what they seem  No, this is no bad dream.   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want  He makes me down to lie  Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by  With bright knives he releaseth my soul  He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places  He converteth me to lamb cutlets  For lo,m he hath great power and great hunger  When cometh the day we lowly ones  Through quiet reflection and great dedication  Master the art of karate  Lo, we shall rise up  And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.   Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream  Wave upon wave of demented avengers  March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream.   Have you heard the news?  The dogs are dead!  You better stay home  And do as you're told  Get out of the road if you want to grow old.You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  So I don't feel alone  Of the weight of the stone  Now that I've found somewhere safe  To bury my bone  And any fool knows a dog needs a home  A shelter from pigs on the wingSo ya Thought ya Might like to go to the show.

All in all it was just a brick in the wall  All in all it was all just bricks in the wallWhen we grew up and went to school   There were certain teachers who would   Hurt the children any way they could   By pouring their derision   Upon anything we did   And exposing every weakness   However carefully hidden by the kids   But in the town it was well known   When they got home at night, their fat and   Psychopathic wives would thrash them   Within inches of their livesWe don't need no education   We don't need no thought control   No dark sarcasm in the classroom   Teachers leave them kids alone   Hey teacher leave them kids alone   All in all it's just another brick in the wall   All in all you're just another brick in the wall   [chorus at end by pupils from the Fourth Form Music Class Islington Green School, London]   We don't need no education   We don't need no thought control   No dark sarcasm in the classroom   Teachers leave them kids alone   Hey teacher leave us kids alone   All in all you're just another brick in the wall   All in all you're just another brick in the wallMother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?

How we used to be? Do you think we should be closer?  She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs Stepping up boldly one put out his hand He said, "I was just a child then. Now I'm only a man."  Do you remember me? How we used to be? Do you think we should be closer?  By the cold and religious we were taken in hand Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay And strung out behind us the banners and flags Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags  Do you remember me?

You pick the place and I'll choose the time  And I'll climb  The hill in my own way  just wait a while, for the right day  And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds  I look down hear the sound of the things you said today  Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling  Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round, frowning  and who's the fool who wears the crown  Go down in your own way  And everyday is the right day  And as you rise above the fearlines in his frown  You look down  Hear the sound of the faces in the crowdThe lunatic is on the grass  The lunatic is on the grass  Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs  Got to keep the loonies on the path  The lunatic is in the hall  The lunatics are in my hall  The paper holds their folded faces to the floor  And every day the paper boy brings more  And if the dam breaks open many years too soon  And if there is no room upon the hill  And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon  The lunatic is in my head  The lunatic is in my head  You raise the blade, you make the change  You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane  You lock the door  And throw away the key  There's someone in my head but it's not me.

There is no dark side of the moon really.  Matter of fact it's all dark.Little by little the night turns around. Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn Lotuses lean on each other in yearning Under the eaves the swallow is resting  Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  Over the mountain watching the watcher. Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine. One inch of love is one inch of shadow Love is the shadow that ripens the wine.  Set the controls for the heart of the sun. The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.  Witness the man who raves at the wall Making the shape of his questions to Heaven Whether the sun will fall in the evening Will he remember the lesson of giving?  Set the controls for the heart of the sun. The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh  She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow  There is no other day  Let's try it another way  You'll lose your mind and play  Free games for may  See Emily play  Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh  Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow  There is no other day  Let's try it another way  You'll lose your mind and play  Free games for may  See Emily play  Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh  Float on a river forever and ever, Emily  There is no other day  Let's try it another way  You'll lose your mind and play  Free games for may  See Emily playThe memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You suffle in gloom in the sickroom And talk to yourself till you die. Life is a short, warm moment And death is a long cold rest. You get your chance to try In the twinkling of an eye: Eighty years, with luck, or even less. So all aboard for the American tour, And maybe you'll make it to the top. And mind how you go. I can tell you, because I know. You may find it hard to get off. You are the angel of death And I am the dead man's son. And he died like a mole in a fox hole. And everyone is still in the run. And who is the master of fox hounds? And who says the hunt has begun? And who calls the tune in the courtroom? And who beats the funeral drum? The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You suffle in gloom in the sickroom And talk to yourself till you die.All this love  Is all I am,  A ball is all I am. I'm so new  Compared to you  And I am very small. Warm glow,  Moon glow,  Always need a little more room. Waiting here, Seems like years, Never see the light of day.  All around  I hear strange sounds  Come gurgling in my ear. Red the light  And dark the night  I feel my dawn is near. Warm glow,  Moon glow, Always need a little more room. Whisper low  Here I go,  I will see the sunshine show.Into the distance, a ribbon of black Stretched to the point of no turning back A flight of fancy on a windswept field Standing alone my senses reeled A fatal attraction is holding me fast, How can I escape this irresistible grasp?  Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I  Ice is forming on the tips of my wings Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything No navigator to find my way home Unladen, empty and turned to stone A soul in tension that's learning to fly Condition grounded but determined to try  Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I  [Spoken:] Friction lock - set.

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer, My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air, Across the clouds I see my shadow fly Out of the corner of my watering eye A dream unthreatened by the morning light Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night  There's no sensation to compare with this Suspended animation, a state of bliss  Can't keep my mind from the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, IDogs of war and men of hate  With no cause, we don't discriminate  Discovery is to be disowned  Our currency is flesh and bone  Hell opened up and put on sale  Gather 'round and haggle  For hard cash, we will lie and deceive  Even our masters don't know the web we weave  One world, it's a battleground  One world, and we will smash it down  One world ... One world  Invisible transfers, long distance calls,  Hollow laughter in marble halls  Steps have been taken, a silent uproar  Has unleashed the dogs of war  You can't stop what has begun  Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion  We all have a dark side, to say the least  And dealing in death is the nature of the beast  One world, it's a battleground  One world, and we will smash it down  One world ... One world  The dogs of war won't negotiate  The dogs of war don't capitulate,  They will take and you will give,  And you must die so that they may live  You can knock at any door,  But wherever you go, you know they've been there before  Well winners can lose and things can get strained  But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.

One worldA restless eye across a weary room  A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin  The music played and played as we whirled without end  No hint, no word her honour to defend   I will, I will she sighed to my request  And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test  Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire  I lead the way to the funeral pyre  And without a thought of the consequence  I gave in to my decadence   One slip, and down the hole we fall  It seems to take no time at all  A momentary lapse of reason  That binds a life for life  A small regret, you won't forget,  There'll be no sleep in here tonight   Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?  Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?  The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown  The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone   One slip, and down the hole we fall  It seems to take no time at all  A momentary lapse of reason  That binds a life for life  A small regret, you won't forget,  There'll be no sleep in here tonight  One slip ... one slipOn the turning away  From the pale and downtrodden  And the words they say  Which we won't understand  "Don't accept that what's happening  Is just a case of others' suffering  Or you'll find that you're joining in  The turning away"   It's a sin that somehow  Light is changing to shadow  And casting it's shroud  Over all we have known  Unaware how the ranks have grown  Driven on by a heart of stone  We could find that we're all alone  In the dream of the proud   On the wings of the night  As the daytime is stirring  Where the speechless unite  In a silent accord  Using words you will find are strange  And mesmerised as they light the flame  Feel the new wind of change  On the wings of the night   No more turning away  From the weak and the weary  No more turning away  From the coldness inside  Just a world that we all must share  It's not enough just to stand and stare  Is it only a dream that there'll be  No more turning away?One sound, one single sound  One kiss, one single kiss  A face outside the window pane  However did it come to this?   A man who ran, a child who cried  A girl who heard, a voice that lied  The sun that burned a fiery red  The vision of an empty bed   The use of force, he was so tough  She'll soon submit, she's had enough  The march of fate, the broken will  Someone is lying very still   He has laughed and he has cried  He has fought and he has died   He's just the same as all the rest  He's not the worst, he's not the best   And still this ceaseless murmuring  The babbling that I brook  The seas of faces, eyes upraised  The empty screen, the vacant look   A man in black on a snow white horse,  A pointless life has run its course,  The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run  As he fades into the setting sunI have always been here  I have always looked out from behind the eyes  It feels like more than a lifetime  Feels like more than a lifetime   Sometimes I get tired of the waiting  Sometimes I get tired of being in here  Is this the way it has always been?  Could it ever have been different?   Do you ever get tired of the waiting?  Do you ever get tired of being in there?  Don't worry, nobody lives forever,  Nobody lives foreverI will always be in here  I will always look out from behind these eyes  It's only a lifetime  It's only a lifetime  It's only a lifetimeThe sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land  Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:  A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,  But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking   He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise  In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise  He's chained forever to a world that's departed  It's not enough, it's not enough   His blood has frozen & curdled with fright  His knees have trembled & given way in the night  His hand has weakened at the moment of truth  His step has faltered   One world, one soul  Time pass, the river rolls   And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication  And silent replies that swirl invitation  Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea  A grim intimation of what is to be   There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night  And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight  And silence that speaks so much louder that words,  Of promises brokenAs you look around this room tonight  Settle in your seat and dim the lights  Do you want my blood, do you want my tears  What do you want  What do you want from me  Should I sing until I can't sing any more  Play these strings until my fingers are raw  You're so hard to please  What do you want from me   Do you think that I know something you don't know  What do you want from me  If I don't promise you the answers would you go  What do you want from me  Should I stand out in the rain  Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you  I'm not the one you need  What do you want from me   You can have anything you want  You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water  Anything you want   You can own everything you see  Sell your soul for complete control  Is that really what you need   You can lose yourself this night  See inside there is nothing to hide  Turn and face the light   What do you want from meOn the day the wall came down  They threw the locks onto the ground  And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived  On the day the wall came down  The Ship of Fools had finally ran aground  Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight   I dreamed you had left my side  No warmth, not even pride remained  And even though you needed me  It was clear that I could not do a thing for you   Now life devalues day by day  As friends and neighbors turn away  And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone  Now frontiers shift like desert sands  While nations wash their bloodied hands  Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey   I woke to the sound of drums  The music played, the morning sun streamed in  I turned and I looked at you  And all but the bitter residues slipped away...slipped awayFrom morning to night I stayed out of sight  Didn't recognize I'd become  No more than alive I'd barely survive  In a word...overrun   Won't hear a sound  From my mouth  I've spent too long  On the inside out  My skin is cold   To the human touch  This bleeding heart's  Not beating much   I murmured a vow of silence and now  I don't even hear when I think aloud  Extinguished by light I turn on the night  Wear its darkness with an empty smile   I'm creeping back to life  My nervous system all awry  I'm wearing the inside out   Look at him now  He's paler somehow  But he's coming round  He's starting to choke  It's been so long since he spoke  Well he can have the words right from my mouth   And with these words I can see  Clear through the clouds that covered me  Just give it time then speak my name  Now we can hear ourselves again   I'm holding out  For the day  When all the clouds  Have blown away  I'm with you now  Can speak your name  Now we can hear  Ourselves againHer love rains down on me easy as the breeze  I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea  I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire  We were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire   She could take it back, she might take it back someday   So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep  Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep  And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take  And I push her to the limit to see if she will break   She might take it back, she could take it back some day   Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides  It's easy to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried  All this temptation, it turned my faith to lies  Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide   She can take it back, she will take it back some day  She can take it back, she will take it back some day  She can take it back, she will take it back some dayWhere were you when I was burned and broken While the days slipped by from my window watching And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless 'Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me  While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words Dying to believe in what you heard I was staring straight into the shining sun  Lost in thought and lost in time While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted Outside the rain fell dark and slow While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime  I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the moment had arrived For killing the past and coming back to life  I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the waiting had begun And headed straight ...into the shining sunFor millions of years mankind lived just like the animals  Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination  We learned to talk   There's a silence surrounding me  I can't seem to think straight  I'll sit in the corner  No one can bother me  I think I should speak now  I can't seem to speak now  My words won't come out right  I feel like I'm drowning  I'm feeling weak now  But I can't show my weakness  I sometimes wonder  Where do we go from here   It doesn't have to be like this  All we need to do is make sure we keep talking   Why won't you talk to me  You never talk to me  What are you thinking  What are you feeling  Why won't you talk to me  You never talk to me  What are you thinking   Where do we go from here   It doesn't have to be like this  All we need to do is make sure we keep talking   Why won't you talk to me  You never talk to me  What are you thinking  What are you feeling  Why won't you talk to me  You never talk to me  What are you thinking  What are you feeling   I feel like I'm drowning  You know I can't breathe now  We're going nowhere  We're going nowhereI was spending my time in the doldrums I was caught in the cauldron of hate I felt persecuted and paralyzed I thought that everything else would just wait While you are wasting your time on your enemies Engulfed in a fever of spite Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades Like shadows into the night  To martyr yourself to caution Is not going to help at all Because there'll be no safety in numbers When the Right One walks out of the door  Can you see your days blighted by darkness? Is it true you beat your fists on the floor? Stuck in a world of isolation While the ivy grows over the door  So I open my door to my enemies And I ask could we wipe the slate clean But they tell me to please go fuck myself You know you just can't winBeyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young  In a world of magnets and miracles  Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary  The ringing of the division bell had begun   Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway  Do they still meet there by the Cut   There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  Running before time took our dreams away  Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground  To a life consumed by slow decay   The grass was greener  The light was brighter  With friends surrounded  The nights of wonder   Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us  To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side  Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again  Dragged by the force of some inner tide   At a higher altitude with flag unfurled  We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world   Encumbered forever by desire and ambition  There's a hunger still unsatisfied  Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon  Though down this road we've been so many times   The grass was greener  The light was brighter  The taste was sweeter  The nights of wonder  With friends surrounded  The dawn mist glowing  The water flowing  The endless river   Forever and everSpeech has allowed the communication of ideas Enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded  All we need to do is make sure we keep talkingWe bitch and we fight Diss each other on sight But this thing we doâ¦  These times you get Rain or shine or stormy weather, This thing we doâ¦  With world-weary grace Weâve taken our places We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name  Or stay home by the fire Failed by desire Stoking the flames But weâre here for the ride  Its Louder than words this thing that we do Louder than words â the way it unfurls Its louder than words â the sum of our parts The beat of our hearts is louder than words Louder than words  The strings bend and slide as the hours fly by An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues, gonna tap out the rhythm  Letâs go with the flow Wherever it goes Weâre more than alive  Its Louder than words this thing that we do Louder than words â the way it unfurls Its louder than words â the sum of our parts The beat of our hearts is louder than words Louder than words â this thing they call soul Is there with a pulse louder than words Louder than wordsGot a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket  Feeling good at the top  Shopping in sharp shoes  Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool  But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores  Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores  Apples and oranges  Apples and oranges   Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly   To meet the people  She's on time again   And then   I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think  What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink  Apples and oranges  Apples and oranges   I love she  She loves me  See you  See you   Thought you might to know  I'm the lorry driver man  She's on the run  Down by the river side  feeding ducks by the afternoon tide  (quack quack)  Apples and oranges  Apples and oranges  Apples and orangesOh my, girl sitting in the sun  Go buy, candy and a currant bun  I like, to see you run  Like that......

So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees,   And I covered them up with the latest cut,   And my pants and socks all point in a box,   They don't make long of my nylon socks,   The watch, black watch   My watch with a black face   And a big pin, a little hole,   And all the lot is what I got,   It's what I wear, it's what you see,   It must be me, it's what I am,   Vegetable man.

Vegetable man, vegetable man,   He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can,   Vegetable man.What shall we use to fill the empty spaces   Where waves of hunger roar?   Shall we set out across the sea of faces   In search of more and more applause?   Shall we buy a new guitar?   Shall we drive a more powerful car?   Shall we work straight through the night?   Shall we get into fights?   Leave the lights on?   Drop bombs?   Do tours of the east?   contract diseases?   Bury bones?   Break up homes?   Send flowers by phone?   Take to drink?   Go to shrinks?   Give up meat?   Rarely sleep?   Keep people as pets?   Train dogs?   Race rats?   Fill the attic with cash?   Bury treasure?   Store up leisure?   But never relax at all   With our backs to the wall.It was just before dawn One miserable morning in black 'forty four. When the forward commander Was told to sit tight When he asked that his men be withdrawn. And the Generals gave thanks As the other ranks held back The enemy tanks for a while. And the Anzio bridgehead Was held for the price Of a few hundred ordinary lives.  And kind old King George Sent Mother a note When he heard that father was gone. It was, I recall, In the form of a scroll, With gold leaf adorned, And I found it one day In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away. And my eyes still grow damp to remember His Majesty signed With his own rubber stamp.  It was dark all around. There was frost in the ground When the tigers broke free. And no one survived From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z. They were all left behind, Most of them dead, The rest of them dying. And that's how the High Command Took my daddy from me.
